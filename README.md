# loopy-java

During Cay Horstmann's recent talk about teaching Java at the 
JChampionsConf 2022 (https://youtu.be/N1gFn07CzA0), we heard about ten
loop patterns that seem to appear over and over. New programmers seem
to find loops and arrays the most challenging when they are learning
a new language.

Professor Horstmann writes about this some more in his blog:

The purpose of this project is for you to try to solve the loops, given the
pseudocode in the article. First try solve them with simple loops and then 
try doing the same thing with Java streams.

If you like, you can compare your loop solution with my branch solution-loops
and your streams solution with my branch solution-streams.

Have fun!

And thank you very much to Cay Horstmann for this fantastic insight.
